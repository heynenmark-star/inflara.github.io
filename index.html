    <h1>Inflara</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      A measurement-driven monetary protocol designed to preserve purchasing power.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      Inflara is a rule-based system that responds to real-world inflation mechanically,
      without discretion, leverage, or speculative incentives.
    </p>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="section">
    <section class="hero fade-in">
    <section class="section fade-in">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Modern monetary systems erode savings through discretionary expansion and opaque
      decision-making. Inflation is measured after the fact, while responses are political,
      delayed, or unevenly applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savers bear the cost. Risk is rewarded. Trust decays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most digital assets replicate this instability in new forms, replacing discretion
      with volatility rather than removing it.

    <h2>How Inflara Works</h2>

    <div class="columns">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Measurement</h3>
        <p>
          Verified price signals and monetary references are observed over time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Black Box Rules</h3>
        <p>
          A deterministic rule engine processes inputs within predefined limits.
          No discretion. No overrides. No retroactive action.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Constrained Output</h3>
        <p>
          Responses are bounded, gradual, and designed to preserve stability rather
          than chase performance.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="note">
      When inputs are noisy or uncertain, the system defaults to inaction.

  <!-- SAVER PROTECTION -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Saver Protection</h2>
    <p>
      Inflara is designed with savers as the primary stakeholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, the protocol seeks to preserve purchasing power by responding to
      measured inflation within predefined bands and caps. No guarantees of real yield
      are made.
    </p>

    <h3>Optional Reference Profiles (Phase 3)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Bitcoin — digital scarcity reference</li>
      <li>Gold — monetary commodity reference</li>
      <li>Silver — secondary monetary commodity reference</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These profiles are opt-in, apply at the account level only, and use partial
      weighting with strict caps and smoothing.
    </p>

  <section class="section muted fade-in">
  <h2>Measurement References</h2>

  <ul class="prices">
    <li>Bitcoin: <span id="btc-price">—</span></li>
    <li>Gold: <span id="gold-price">—</span></li>
    <li>Silver: <span id="silver-price">—</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    References are read-only and used for measurement and contextual calibration only.
    Inflara does not custody or hold external assets.
